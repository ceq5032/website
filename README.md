# website
I am currently experimenting with AI to develop a website. I aim to test the AI's working knowledge of HTTP/CSS/JAVA, where it takes my recommendations and creates the code accordingly. However, I have noticed that the AI program is making a lot of errors, even when I try to correct it. Interestingly, the AI apologizes for being wrong, but it doesn't rectify the error. I am documenting my progress in the README file, and this experiment is purely for fun and not for any academic purposes.
